# scarycfg
!!! Because of github's 100mb file limit, this repo doesn't include the no_hats_bgum.vpk file. You can fetch it from source here: https://pevhs.ch/tf2/vpk/nhbgum/no_hats_bgum.vpk !!!

This config is made firstmost for myself, so you probably will want to edit the autoexec.cfg since I'm using the colemak-DH US keyboard layout(windows) and the sens is set in the autoexec. You will also need an external fps limiter.

Set this as your tf2 launch options(change this if you know what you are doing):
'''
+exec w/config -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1
'''
# to-dos

- add the advanced settings cfg(tiresome)
- try enabling player shadows(idk about this one)
- selectievly make viewmodels invisible with horsies viewmodel editor or something else(I only play scout rn so I just r_drawviewmodel 0 lol)
- also with horsies viewmodel editor, remove the first person flames on pyro
- a better installation process with unbind all..?
- quiter scout primary and secondary sounds
- add description to the readme
- add screenshots to the readme
- add a keybind map to readme

## Installation
To install, first make sure that you have a completely clean tf2 copy that has no config already installed, then just download the repo, open the .zip with 7zip or something and place the "tf" file into your tf2 folder(usually on windows it's "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2"). Don't forget the no_hats_bgum.vpk file! Download it and place into tf/custom folder(in your tf2 installation ofc).

## Legality
I quickly went through the etf2l and rgl rules and I'm not really sure about the flat characters mod(It's preloaded). Otherwise this is fine I think(please correct me if I'm wrong here).

100% not vac bannable.

## Issues
- Regular weapons look odd with the flat mercs, I couldn't been able to preload the flat weapons mod(this is a to-do probs)
- Not all textures are flat...
- Hud's customization menu doesn't work with comfig-custom. The fix is to temporarily remove the comfig-custom, launch tf2 and do the hud changes, then add the comfig-custom back.
- I don't think all the regular binds are actually bound
- probably more things that I've forgot about
